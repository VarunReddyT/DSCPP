// Types of Binary Tree
// Full Binary Tree
// Complete Binary Tree
// Perfect Binary Tree
// Balanced Binary Tree
// Degenerate or Pathological Tree
// Skewed Binary Tree


// Full Binary Tree : A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children. The following are the examples of a full binary tree.
// Complete Binary Tree : A Binary Tree is a complete binary tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible. The following are examples of Complete Binary Trees.
// Perfect Binary Tree : A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. The following are the examples of Perfect Binary Trees.
// Balanced Binary Tree : A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes. For Example, AVL tree maintains O(Log n) height by making sure that the difference between heights of the left and right subtrees is 1. Red-Black trees maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that the number of Black nodes on every root to leaf paths are same and there are no adjacent red nodes. Balanced Binary Search trees are performance-wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.
// Degenerate or Pathological Tree : A Tree where every internal node has one child. Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list.
// Skewed Binary Tree : A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree. Example of left-skewed binary tree is given below.
