// Given the number of visitors at her local theme park on N consecutive days. The number of visitors on the ith day is Vi. A day is record breaking if it satisfies both the following conditions :
// 1. The number of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the number of visitors of the previous days
// 2. Either it is the largest or number of visitors on the day is stricly larger than the number of visitors on the following day.
// Note that the very first day could be the record breaking day.
// Number of record breaking days.

/*
create a record breaker program in C++ using arrays to keep track of daily scores.

Sample Input-Output:
